#Aletheia:

Aletheia is a decentralised open access scientific journal. Think of it as a peer to peer (P2P) publishing platform and database. You can submit original scientific research or existing non copywrited research to help build up our library, and you can access our library to download articles, all free of charge.

##Repository:

All logo documentation Kade has comissioned for Aletheia from Zac Smith-Cameron. Logo design has been driven by feedback from Aletheia contributors.
